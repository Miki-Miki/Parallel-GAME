# Parallel-GAME
Demo build for our game "Parallel". 

My friends Velid (Weh1D) and I, made this interesting little game for the 
annual FIT Coding Chellenge (a competition consisting of four 
categories: programming chellenge, game development, inovation chellenge and cyber olympics).

This is a demo build.
Repository includes the game's trailer presented at the Coding Chellenge, 
the game document briefly describing the game,
and the game files (zipped) themselves.
No installation required.

If you encounter any bugs or glitches please reach out to me or my friend, thank you.
Enjoy.
